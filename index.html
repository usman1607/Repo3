                improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. Every culture has its own stories or narratives, 
                which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling 
                moral values.[1] Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and 
                narrative point of view. With the advent of writing and the use of stable, portable media, stories were recorded, 
                transcribed and shared over wide regions of the world. Stories have been carved, scratched, 
                painted, printed or inked onto wood or bamboo, ivory and other bones, pottery, clay tablets, 
                stone, palm-leaf books, skins (parchment), bark cloth, paper, silk, canvas and other textiles,
